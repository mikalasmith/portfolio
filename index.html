        <p>Mikala Smith is a budding full stack web developer, currently attending UNCC's coding bootcamp program. She originally
          hails from Charlotte, NC, and considers Chapel Hill, NC to be her second home. She attended UNC-Chapel Hill and
          graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Global Studies.</p>

        <p>She now works as an English Teaching Assistant at an elementary school. She likes to think of herself as doing her
          best to help craft the young minds of the next generation, or as her students would put it, "The lady who just
          <i>won't</i> let up on grammar."</p>

        <p>Just last year, she lived in the quaint, and beautiful town of Albacete, Spain, where she also worked as an English
          Teaching Assistant, and did not let up on grammar with her students there either. In her free time she likes to
          travel whenever she can, and when she cannot, she likes to get lost in a good book, a good netflix series, or go
          on what she calls a "leisurely run", but what many others simply refer to as "walking." As technology continues
          to increase its prevalency in the classroom, she hopes to bridge her passion for teaching English with her new
          passion for coding to make a difference in the education system. </p>
